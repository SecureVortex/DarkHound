# DarkHound

DarkHound is an automated dark web monitoring and alerting tool designed to continuously scan dark web sources—marketplaces, forums, and breach databases—for evidence that Osborne Clarke (OC) user accounts or credentials have been leaked or are for sale.

## Core Features

- **Keyword/Domain Monitoring**: Searches for `@osborneclarke.com` emails, usernames, and related keywords on dark web sites.
- **Credential Exposure Detection**: Flags usernames, passwords, hashes, or PII tied to OC users.
- **Threat Intel Integration**: Leverages APIs like HaveIBeenPwned, DeHashed, DarkOwl, Flare, or Cybersixgill.
- **AI-Powered Text Mining**: NLP models scan leaked dataset dumps, discussions, and posts for OC mentions.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends real-time alerts to SOC via Slack, Teams, or email if OC data is found.
- **Risk Scoring**: Prioritizes findings by severity.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** for automation and scraping
- **Tor proxy** for safe dark web access
- **NLP** (spaCy or HuggingFace) for entity extraction
- **SQLite/Postgres** for storing leaks
- **Dashboard** (Streamlit/Flask) for analyst review

## Quick Start
